# notes
In Fall 2025, I started writing notes for the subjects I've learned.
I am against typing notes for *learning* a subject, as it's an inefficient method,
but typed notes are very useful for *storing* knowledge for future reference.

I develop the subjects in a way I see logically fit; as such, I do not follow
any particular resource--these notes are typed up from memory after I've had time
to think things through myself.

A few differences I usually implement are mathematical precision, simplicity,
and motivation. I also explicitly compute things that most books skimp out on,
e.g. vector spherical harmonics for approximating the vector potential, or explicitly
computing the Dirac matrices up to D = 11. I skip things I think I will not forget,
so some basic points are likely missing. I also write these notes assuming knowledge
of the subject already, so I will reference things later in the subject freely (but
I do define everything I use in the main text, i.e. I only reference things later in the
subject off-handedly).

My notes are **not** meant to be learned from, but if you already know a
subject, they might be a useful reference.
