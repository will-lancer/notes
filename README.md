# notes
In Fall 2025, I started writing notes for the subjects I've learned.
I am generally against typing notes, as they're an inefficient way to learn, but I
think once you know a subject, typing up notes for future reference can be very beneficial.

I develop the subjects in a way I see logically fit, and as such I do not follow
the approach of any resource I know. I am more mathematically precise than
most resources, try to always develop things as simply as possible, and I have 
certain computational results that are hard to find
elsewhere (e.g. vector spherical harmonics for approximating the vector potential).
I will also sometimes skip something if I think I can derive it myself later or if I know I
won't forget it. 

My notes are **not** meant to be learned from, but if you already know the subject
they cover you might learn something from reading them.
